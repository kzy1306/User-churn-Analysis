# User-churn-Analysis
Understanding the factors that contribute to user churn is critical for retaining users and improving overall user experience.

**Objective:** The primary objective of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create detailed visualizations to uncover insights about user behavior and churn patterns. These insights will inform strategies to reduce churn and enhance user retention. Our findings and visualizations will be compiled into a Python notebook for review by Harriet Hadzic, Waze's Director of Data Analysis.
